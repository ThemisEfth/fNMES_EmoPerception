Description

This project analyses behavioural data collected during an experiment investigating the effects of facial Neuromuscular Electrical Stimulation (fNMES) on emotional processing. The study examines how zygomaticus muscle activation through NMES influences participants’ perception of ambiguous facial expressions.

Key aspects of the analysis include:
	•	Cleaning and preprocessing of behavioural data (removing practice trials, missing data, and outliers).
	•	Calculation of the Point of Subjective Equality (PSE) for each participant and at group level.
	•	Modelling using logistic mixed-effects models to evaluate the effect of NMES on emotion perception.
	•	Visualisation of raw data, descriptive statistics, and model predictions.
	•	Integration of demographic, PANAS affective state measures, stimulation intensity, and comfort level data.
